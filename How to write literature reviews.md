## How to write literature reviews?


•	<strong>Purpose.</strong> Determine why you are reviewing literature, first all. Is it to identify gaps, to understand a concept, find a reference for your argument? If you don’t do this, you will aimlessly wander through masses of literature.


•	<strong>Skim.</strong> As you come across papers, skim them. Do NOT read them full. Determine whether they’re even relevant, and hoe relevant they are to the aim of your lit review. If they’re not at all relevant, move on. After you skim, assign the paper a relevance score from 1-5, 5 being super relevant, 3 being not sure, 1 – being ‘just in case’. 


•	<strong>Record.</strong> If a paper has been assigned a relevance score during the skim phase, record some low-level details in your literature database (Obsidian, Zotero, Lateral.io, Notion, Google doc). Like author name, relevant to, and so on. This is ‘recording’, not reviewing, this means that just screenshots of relevant sections of the paper can also make it into your database. 


•	<strong>Review.</strong> Now, if a paper has achieved a relevance score above 3, you need to review it. Do more than just skimming the paper, review it by critically analyzing it. For example, questioning the authors presentation of chosen literature, the kind of evidence presented and examining whether these work, and so on. 


•	<strong>Synthesize.</strong> Once you’ve reviewed individual papers, it’s time to start bringing them together. A literature review is more than just stating and describing what individual papers have reported. You need to integrate what you’ve been reviewing to form your own arguments about existing literature.
